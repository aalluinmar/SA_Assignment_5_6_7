      0. We estimated around 4 hours to do this project, and then it took around 5 hours to complete this project. The installations took more time and so took 5 hours. Otherwise spending 4 hours is a good estimate for this project.


      2. Automation API hyperlink is the link that is used to refer to the other document or method calls or any other stuff - which will be helpful for easy access of the code/data and saves the time for finding out the code/logic resides.
      For instance, in HTML we use hyperlinks for anchor tags, which helps to redirect to the other page. Same with the API document referencing, which helps to redirect to the specific code. In syntactical format, we inject the hyperlink method calling functionality to the current referencing object. If we click this object, it will redirect to the specific API which helps to identify the code or document easily.
      <a HREF="reference_page_or_code">...</a>
      In the below link, the document shows various variables, methods, classes, and constructors and each has individual representation and syntaxes, - it also which have hyperlinks of its own that help to redirect the referencing documents.
